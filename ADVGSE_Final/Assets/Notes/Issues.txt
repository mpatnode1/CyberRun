Bugs
- Boxes in first hallway need ground layer so player can jump past first box


Next Progress
- Need to implement actual assets sooner rather than later to know space limits on patroller
- Need AI script that will have enemies patrol, then stop when player is in sight,
    then, move within range to shoot or move within range for melee combat
    (depending on enemy)
- Need player health
- Need player to be able to shoot - (May need to convert script to new Input system)
- Need Menu
